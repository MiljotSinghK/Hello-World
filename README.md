# Hello-World
In this Repository,i shall review my basics to solve simple problems.

1.Armstrong Number-these are such numbers whose sum of digits to a power of number of total digits would give the same number .For example 1634 would expand like this: (1)^4 + (6)^4 + (3)^4
+ (4)^4= 1+1296+81+256=1634
